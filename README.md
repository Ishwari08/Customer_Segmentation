# Customer Segmentation and Personality Analysis

## Business Objective
- Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers 
  from different types of customer segments.
- Finding the potential customers by analysing the behaviour of them is useful to understand the 
  targeted customers.    
- For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s 
  database, a company can analyse which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then 
  market the product only on that particular segment.
