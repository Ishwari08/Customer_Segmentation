# Customer Segmentation and Personality Analysis

## Business Objective
- Customer personality analysis helps a business to modify its product based on its target customers 
  from different types of customer segments.
- Finding the potential customers by analysing the behaviour of them is useful to understand the 
  targeted customers.    
- For example, instead of spending money to market a new product to every customer in the company’s 
  database, a company can analyse which customer segment is most likely to buy the product and then 
  market the product only on that particular segment.

## 22Architecture level analysis:
1.	Understand the business statement how we can approach
2.	EDA should be done on the given dataset.
3.	Need to perform clustering to summarize customer segments.
4.	Deployment through R Shiny or Flask/ Streamlit

## Protocols:
1)	All participants should add here to agreed timelines and timelines will not be extended
2)	All the documentation – Final presentation and R/python code to be submitted before the final 
    presentation day
3)	All the participants must attend review meetings
